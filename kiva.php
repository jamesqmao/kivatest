Task 1

With this information create a script (using any language you feel most comfortable in) that queries the API for funded status loans, e.g. http://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/search.json?status=funded

 

Choose a loan from the list and pull its information, e.g. http://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/300000.json

 

Then, also pull a list of that loanâ€™s lenders, e.g http://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/300000/lenders.json

 

There is more background information on the API and its use on build.kiva.org as well as at https://github.com/kiva/API

Task 2

 

Use the loan information you gathered above ( e.g:  "loan_amount":100 (in USD), "repayment_term":7 (in months)) to build out a loan repayment schedule into a database table.  

 

Then use the list of lenders and determine an estimated repayment schedule for each one. Create a database schema to hold this information and a script that distributes the repayments equally across the lenders. This creates an audit trail that each lender received back the amount they put into the loan.
